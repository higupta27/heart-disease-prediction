# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project explores predictive modeling techniques to **identify individuals at risk of heart disease** using a dataset from Kaggle. We compare the performance of **Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle’s Heart Failure Prediction Dataset (918 observations, 11 features).  
- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression (Baseline)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest (Best Model)  
- **Best Performing Model:** **Random Forest (88% accuracy)**
