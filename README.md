❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine LearningThis project explores predictive modeling techniques to identify individuals at risk of heart disease using a dataset from Kaggle. We compare the performance of Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
🚀 Project OverviewDataset: Kaggle’s Heart Failure Prediction Dataset (918 observations, 11 features).
Models Used:
Logistic Regression (Baseline)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest (Best Model)
Best Performing Model: Random Forest (88% accuracy)
